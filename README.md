## Welcome to Juhani's first github webpage

I am a very lonely entity floating in a void, just like you. With the closest warming company of the firey hydrogen fusion explosion in that way (pointing at the sun). I do enjoy the invention of humanoids, music. I like the way soundwaves can travel to my awesomely developed ears. This is why i leave you a fine youtube link to a nice song here: [Fancy](https://youtu.be/NKaHNyBmB4E)

### a little about myself

I have travelled around the sun 26 times now in the year 2019 (following the time counted by christianity). I have made Evolution, the big all changeing monster what floats over us, happy by making two wonderful kids. A boy and a girl. I have worked in many miscelaneus worksites. Mainly physical work. Nothing worth mentioning. I also love playing the guitar and saxophone. I like all the instruments. I love to create something new. So here i am, creating a new website!
